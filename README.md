# Campfried Egg

Throwing eggs at mobs is fine and so is baking cakes, but don't you wish you could do more with them? Now you can!

Place an egg on a campfire, and voil√†! You've got yourself a fried egg:

![It gives 2 hunger points and a bit over 2 saturation points.](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/X9RYCN8m/images/e9e943ea83a1c4297aa9ada680d7b25cc029a106.png)

They :
- take 30 seconds to cook
- give you 0.15 experience points when cooked
- fill 4 (2 hunger points)
- restore 0.55 saturation
- are stackable up to 64

Tested with Fabric API 0.91.0+1.20.1

This mod is provided "as is". It should technically work on all 1.20.X versions of the game. I am not planning to update/backport this mod to a different version of Minecraft. You're free to do so yourself, however.
